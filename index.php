      <p>Our first book, <em>No Lunch, No Money, No Rice: The Pursuit of Education in Asia</em> is about education in Asia, but not through statistics, through personal narratives and photographs.   It tells people’s stories—in their own words—of getting an education in Asia.  Some of these stories are profound and inspiring, while others are funny.  Many are both sad and enlightening.</p>
