          <p>Katrina and Tadashi have been traveling the world since 2004, mainly to Southeast Asia.  They travel flexibly, and if they don't like a place, they'll leave early, and if they fall in love with a place, they'll stay longer.  They strive to meet the local people, and so they tend to stay away from the big cities and hotels, preferring smaller places where it's easier to make connections.  In this way, they have made friends all over the world, and have helped bring running water to people's house, payed for many children to attend school, helped an adult finish their education, and helped start two small businesses.  They see themselves as providing the support that student loans have given so many of us in the United States.  Except instead of being payed back, the people they support pay it forward.  Their first book, "<a href="/" title="">No Lunch, No Money, No Rice: The Pursuit of Education in Asia</a>" was a labor of love, and is filled with the stories they would tell friends when they asked, "How was your trip?"</p>
